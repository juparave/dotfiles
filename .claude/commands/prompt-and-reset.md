Generate a well-formatted prompt for the task: $ARGUMENTS

Create a clear, actionable prompt that includes:
- Context and background
- Specific requirements 
- Expected deliverables
- Any constraints or preferences

After generating the prompt, copy it to clipboard so you can:
1. Reset this Claude session (Cmd+R or /reset)
2. Paste the prompt (Cmd+V) to start fresh

!echo "Task prompt generated and copied to clipboard. Ready to reset session with Cmd+R, then paste with Cmd+V"
